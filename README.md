Extraction and pre-processing of summarization datasets from the New York Times Annotated Corpus ([LDC2008T19](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T19)).

### Installation

This library was developed and tested under Python 3.4. Feel free to send me errors or pull requests for extending compatibility to earlier versions of Python.

We depend on [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) for first-pass sentence splitting and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) for verb detection via part-of-speech tagging.
```
$ pip install nltk
$ pip install spacy
$ python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Usage

The typical flow for constructing a summarization dataset consists of:
  * Reading the compressed NYT corpus on disk and caching documents with the required topics and summaries in a [shelf](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html). This is skipped if the shelf already exists.
  * Filtering these documents as per summary properties like length and degree of extractiveness and pre-processing them to resolve errors and artifacts.
  * Splitting the filtered dataset into a train/dev/test partition and caching it for further experimentation.

This flow is illustrated in `main.py` with all relevant parameters exposed as command-line arguments. To get started, run:
```
main.py --help
```
